A Greasemonkey Script for detecting malware scripts

The version 2 is similar to XSS warning addon. Look for URL string for XSS payloads. Detect and stop XSS attacks from evil bad guys to you in addition to detection of Malicious JavaScript embedded in malicious sites. This script has been tested for false positives thoroughly. False positives may occur at those sites which use crypto strings like order.php?token={a:xC2;id:ac3f52233;.md} and Squirrel mail sites which use URL strings like compose.php?to=John. We can't fix it for the sake of security. If you know this one, you can feel assured this is safe to accept and go on.
